# UX Improvement Test - Modeless Form Button Refresh

## Issue Description
In modeless mode, after extracting segments from cells, the UserForm buttons still showed old pipe-delimited previews instead of reflecting the new single-value cell content.

## Solution Implemented
Added automatic form refresh after extraction operations to immediately update button captions with current cell content.

## Test Scenario

### Setup Data
```
A1: FY24_26|Q1-4|Tourism WA|WA|Marketing:TEST123
A2: Campaign|Q2|Media|AU|Digital:ACTIVATION456
```

### Test Steps

#### Test 1: Extraction Updates Form Immediately
1. Run `TaxonomyExtractorModeless()`
2. Select cell A1
3. **Expected**: Form shows buttons like:
   - `"1: FY24_26"`
   - `"2: Q1-4"`  
   - `"3: Tourism WA"`
   - `"4: WA"`
   - `"5: Marketing"`
   - `"ID: TEST123"`
4. Click button `"3: Tourism WA"`
5. **Expected**: 
   - Cell A1 now contains: `Tourism WA`
   - Form immediately updates to show:
     - `"1: Tourism WA"` (enabled)
     - `"2: N/A"` (disabled, greyed)
     - `"3: N/A"` (disabled, greyed)
     - All other buttons: `"N/A"` (disabled, greyed)
     - `"ID: N/A"` (disabled, greyed)

#### Test 2: Selection Change After Extraction
1. (Continuing from Test 1)
2. Select cell A2 (still has pipe-delimited data)
3. **Expected**: Form updates to show A2 data:
   - `"1: Campaign"`
   - `"2: Q2"`
   - `"3: Media"`
   - `"4: AU"`
   - `"5: Digital"`
   - `"ID: ACTIVATION456"`

#### Test 3: Extract from Second Cell
1. (Continuing from Test 2, A2 selected)
2. Click button `"1: Campaign"`
3. **Expected**:
   - Cell A2 now contains: `Campaign`
   - Form immediately updates to show:
     - `"1: Campaign"` (enabled)  
     - All other buttons: `"N/A"` (disabled, greyed)

#### Test 4: Undo Restores Original Previews
1. (Continuing from Test 3)
2. Click "Undo Last" button
3. **Expected**:
   - Cell A2 restored to: `Campaign|Q2|Media|AU|Digital:ACTIVATION456`
   - Form immediately updates to show original pipe-delimited previews:
     - `"1: Campaign"`
     - `"2: Q2"`
     - `"3: Media"`
     - `"4: AU"`
     - `"5: Digital"`
     - `"ID: ACTIVATION456"`

## Technical Implementation

### Functions Modified
- `ExtractPipeSegment()`: Added `RefreshModelessFormIfOpen()` call
- `ExtractActivationID()`: Added `RefreshModelessFormIfOpen()` call  
- `UndoTaxonomyCleaning()`: Added `RefreshModelessFormIfOpen()` call

### New Function Added
- `RefreshModelessFormIfOpen()`: Checks if modeless form is open, gets current selection, parses content, and updates form

### UX Flow
```
User clicks extraction button
     ↓
Extraction function processes cells
     ↓
Cell content changes (pipes removed)
     ↓
RefreshModelessFormIfOpen() is called
     ↓
Current selection is re-parsed
     ↓
Form updated with new single-value content
     ↓
Buttons show "N/A" for missing segments
```

## Success Criteria
✅ **Immediate Update**: Button captions update instantly after extraction
✅ **Accurate Reflection**: Buttons show current cell content, not old previews  
✅ **Proper Disabling**: Missing segments show "N/A" and are disabled/greyed
✅ **Undo Support**: Undo restores both cell content and button previews
✅ **Selection Switching**: Works correctly when switching between cells
✅ **No Performance Impact**: Updates happen smoothly without lag

## Benefits
- **Real-time Feedback**: Users see immediate results of their actions
- **Clear State**: No confusion about what data is currently being previewed
- **Professional UX**: Smooth, responsive interface behavior
- **Consistency**: Works seamlessly with existing selection change updates

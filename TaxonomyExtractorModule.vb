'================================================================================
' EXCEL TAXONOMY EXTRACTOR - Main Module
'================================================================================
' 
' INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
' 1. Open Excel VBA Editor (Alt + F11)
' 2. Right-click your project â†’ Insert â†’ Module
' 3. Copy and paste this entire code into the new module
' 4. Optionally create the UserForm (see TaxonomyExtractorForm.vb for instructions)
'
' USAGE:
' 1. Select cells with pipe-delimited text (e.g., "Marketing|Campaign|Q4|Social|Facebook")
' 2. Run the TaxonomyExtractor macro (assign to button or use Alt+F8)
' 3. Choose segment number to extract that specific part
'
' EXAMPLES:
' For text "FY24_26|Q1-4|Tourism WA|WA |Always On Remarketing| 4LAOSO | SOC|Facebook_Instagram|Conversions:DJTDOM060725":
' - Segment 1: "FY24_26" (1st segment)
' - Segment 3: "Tourism WA" (3rd segment) 
' - Segment 5: "Always On Remarketing" (5th segment)
' - Segment 9: "Conversions" (9th segment)
' - Activation ID: "DJTDOM060725" (after colon)

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Workflow - Building New Releases

This section is for developers maintaining and improving the Excel Taxonomy Extractor codebase.

### When to Increment Version

**Follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer):**
- ‚úÖ **Major (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes that affect existing functionality
- ‚úÖ **Minor (X.Y.0)**: New features, UI improvements, or significant enhancements
- ‚úÖ **Patch (X.Y.Z)**: Bug fixes, small improvements, or performance optimizations

**Version Locations to Update:**
1. `TaxonomyExtractorForm.vb` - UserForm caption with new version number
2. `TaxonomyExtractorModule.vb` - Error messages with new version number
3. `install.ps1` - Script header, AddInName, DisplayName with new version
4. `README.md` - Main heading and version history section
5. `CLAUDE.md` - Project overview version references

### Step-by-Step Release Process

#### 1. **Code Development & Testing**
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature-name

# Make your VB code changes in:
# - TaxonomyExtractorModule.vb
# - TaxonomyExtractorForm.vb

# Update version numbers in all files listed above
# Test thoroughly in Excel VBA environment
```

#### 2. **Update Documentation**
- Update `README.md` version history with new features
- Update `CLAUDE.md` with technical changes
- Commit all code and documentation changes

#### 3. **Build XLAM Binary**
**Critical: Build the XLAM from the PREVIOUS release, not from scratch**

```bash
# Download the current release XLAM file
# Go to: https://github.com/henkisdabro/excel-taxonomy-cleaner/releases/latest
# Download the latest XLAM file (e.g., ipg_taxonomy_extractor_addonvX.Y.Z.xlam)
```

**In Excel:**
1. **Open the downloaded XLAM** from the previous release
2. **Press Alt+F11** to open VBA Editor
3. **Replace the VB code** with your updated code:
   - Copy new `TaxonomyExtractorModule.vb` content into the existing module
   - Update `TaxonomyExtractorForm` with new form code
4. **Verify the ribbon CustomUI XML** is still embedded (should be preserved)
5. **Test the functionality** thoroughly
6. **Save as new version**: `File ‚Üí Save As` ‚Üí `ipg_taxonomy_extractor_addonvX.Y.Z.xlam` (using semantic versioning)
7. **Close Excel**

#### 4. **Create GitHub Release**
```bash
# Push your branch and create PR
git push origin feature-name

# After merging to main:
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and push tag (using semantic versioning)
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

**On GitHub:**
1. Go to **Releases** ‚Üí **Create a new release**
2. **Tag**: `vX.Y.Z` (semantic version)
3. **Title**: `Excel Taxonomy Extractor vX.Y.Z`
4. **Description**: List new features, improvements, and bug fixes
5. **Upload the XLAM file**: `ipg_taxonomy_extractor_addonvX.Y.Z.xlam`
6. **Publish release**

#### 5. **Verify Installation**
Test the PowerShell installer picks up the new version:
```powershell
irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/henkisdabro/excel-taxonomy-cleaner/main/install.ps1?$(Get-Date -UFormat %s)" | iex
```

### üéØ **Developer Checklist**
- [ ] Version numbers updated in all 5 locations (following semantic versioning)
- [ ] VB code tested in Excel environment
- [ ] Documentation updated (README.md, CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] XLAM built from previous release (preserves CustomUI)
- [ ] GitHub release created with proper semantic version tag
- [ ] XLAM binary uploaded to release with correct filename
- [ ] PowerShell installer tested with new version
- [ ] Old version cleanup verified in install script

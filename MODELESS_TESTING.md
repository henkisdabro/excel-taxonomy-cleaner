# Modeless UserForm Testing Guide

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive testing procedures for the new modeless UserForm functionality in Excel Taxonomy Extractor v1.4.0.

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Microsoft Excel with VBA enabled
2. All project files imported:
   - `TaxonomyExtractorModule.vb` (main module)
   - `TaxonomyExtractorForm.vb` (UserForm code)
   - `clsAppEvents.vb` (class module for application events)

### Test Data
Use these sample taxonomy strings in Excel cells:

```
A1: FY24_26|Q1-4|Tourism WA|WA |Always On Remarketing| 4LAOSO | SOC|Facebook_Instagram|Conversions:DJTDOM060725
A2: Campaign|Q2|Media|AU|Digital:TEST123
A3: Simple|Two|Segments
A4: NoDataHere (no pipes)
A5: Empty cell
```

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Basic Modeless Functionality
**Objective**: Verify UserForm opens in modeless mode and allows Excel interaction

**Steps**:
1. Select cell A1
2. Run `TaxonomyExtractorModeless()` macro
3. Verify UserForm appears but Excel remains interactive
4. Click on cell A2 without closing the form
5. Verify you can select different cells while form is open

**Expected Results**:
- Form opens and doesn't block Excel
- Excel cells remain selectable
- Form stays on top but doesn't prevent interaction

### Test 2: Real-time Selection Updates
**Objective**: Verify form updates when selection changes

**Steps**:
1. Run `TaxonomyExtractorModeless()` with A1 selected
2. Form should show A1 data previews on buttons
3. Click on cell A2 (without closing form)
4. Form should automatically update to show A2 data
5. Click on cell A3
6. Form should update again

**Expected Results**:
- Button captions change to reflect newly selected data
- lblInstructions shows current selection content
- Updates happen automatically without user action

### Test 3: Data Validation and Edge Cases
**Objective**: Test form behavior with invalid/edge case data

**Steps**:
1. Select A1, run modeless form
2. Click on A4 (no pipe data)
3. Click on A5 (empty cell)
4. Click back on A1 (valid data)

**Expected Results**:
- A4: Form shows "no pipe-delimited data" message, buttons unchanged
- A5: Form shows "empty selection" message
- A1: Form updates back to valid previews

### Test 4: Extraction While Modeless
**Objective**: Verify extraction works on currently selected cells

**Steps**:
1. Run modeless form with A1 selected
2. Click "Segment 3" button (should extract "Tourism WA")
3. Without closing form, select A2
4. Click "Segment 1" button (should extract "Campaign")
5. Select range A1:A2, click "Segment 2" button

**Expected Results**:
- Each extraction operates on currently selected cells
- No need to reopen form between extractions
- Batch processing works with multiple selected cells

### Test 5: Undo Functionality in Modeless Mode
**Objective**: Test undo system works correctly

**Steps**:
1. Run modeless form, extract segments from A1
2. Extract different segment from A2
3. Click "Undo Last" button
4. Verify only the most recent operation is undone

**Expected Results**:
- Undo reverses the last extraction only
- Previous extractions remain unchanged
- Undo data properly maintained across selection changes

### Test 6: Form Cleanup and Memory Management
**Objective**: Verify proper cleanup when form is closed

**Steps**:
1. Run modeless form
2. Change selections several times
3. Close form using "Close" button
4. Check Debug.Print output for cleanup messages
5. Run modeless form again to verify fresh start

**Expected Results**:
- "UserForm_Terminate: Cleaned up modeless events" appears in debug
- Application events properly disconnected
- No memory leaks or hanging references
- Form can be reopened without issues

### Test 7: Multiple Range Selection
**Objective**: Test behavior with multiple cell selection

**Steps**:
1. Select range A1:A3
2. Run modeless form
3. Form should show A1 data (first cell)
4. Click segment button - should process all three cells
5. Select different range A2:A4, verify form updates

**Expected Results**:
- Form displays first cell data for preview
- Extractions process entire selection
- Range changes update form preview appropriately

### Test 8: Workbook/Worksheet Navigation
**Objective**: Test form behavior when switching worksheets/workbooks

**Steps**:
1. Run modeless form on Sheet1
2. Switch to Sheet2 with form still open
3. Select cells on Sheet2
4. Return to Sheet1, select original cells

**Expected Results**:
- Form remains accessible across sheets
- Selection changes on different sheets update form
- No crashes or unexpected behavior

## Debug Information

### Enable Debug Output
All functions include Debug.Print statements. View output in VBA Immediate Window (Ctrl+G):

```vba
' Key debug messages to watch for:
UpdateForNewSelection: Updated form for new selection: [data]
clsAppEvents.App_SheetSelectionChange Error: [any errors]
UserForm_Terminate: Cleaned up modeless events
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Form doesn't update on selection change**:
- Check if clsAppEvents class is properly instantiated
- Verify Application.EnableEvents = True
- Check for errors in Immediate Window

**Excel becomes unresponsive**:
- Likely recursive event loop
- Check Application.EnableEvents management
- Force-close form and restart Excel if needed

**Memory issues after multiple uses**:
- Verify CleanupModelessEvents is being called
- Check for Set AppEvents = Nothing in cleanup
- Look for Debug cleanup messages

## Performance Validation

### Expected Performance Characteristics
- **Form Opening**: < 1 second
- **Selection Updates**: Near-instantaneous (< 0.5 seconds)
- **Extraction Operations**: Same speed as modal version
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal increase over modal version

### Performance Test
1. Run modeless form
2. Rapidly click between 10 different cells with taxonomy data
3. Monitor for lag or delay in updates
4. Close form and check memory usage

## Success Criteria

✅ **Modeless Operation**: Form allows Excel interaction while open
✅ **Real-time Updates**: Form content updates automatically on selection change
✅ **Data Validation**: Proper handling of invalid/empty data
✅ **Extraction Accuracy**: All extraction functions work on current selection
✅ **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup with no leaks
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases
✅ **Performance**: Responsive updates without lag
✅ **Compatibility**: Works across worksheets and workbooks
